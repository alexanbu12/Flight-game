        W for North

        S for SOUTH
        D for EAST
        add - to go southeast or southwest, add + to go to northwest or southeast
        Then add an longitude angle. 5,15,45 or 85. If you think you don't need an angle just enter the direction example: S
        Also add distance to go to the closest airport in KM
        First guess the distance (example: 350)
        Secondly enter the angle then direction (example: +45A) 
        You will always start from Finland, your goal is to fly to the target country with highest efficiency.
        If you take a wrong turn you lose the game!
